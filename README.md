# Ilmapallo 2 - a CMS based on Angular 2, node.js, express and mongodb
This is a rewrite of my earlier attempts to implement a CMS on the MEAN stack using the Angular 2
framework. This time, I didn't go with any sort of boilerplate, but started from scratch. webpack is
used for client side compilation, and npm scripts are used instead of any build system like grunt or gulp.
